In this assignment, i have created the full board game. up to this point, I have implemented 
all the features for the complete game. The getword() function is correctly collecting the 
letters and form the word either vertically or horizonally. i intented to use this function
to check with dictionary funciton. however i have not yet implemente the dictionary checking feature.
for that reason, i don't make use of getword() for this project. i'll do it later. the calculatePlayScore() 
function is implemented, but it don't work correctly. But i do put the solution to correct the problem. 
the play button sometime is not working, you will need to refresh to start again. 
so, there are 3 missing features to fully complete this game.
one is the dictionary checking, scoring and put more player (up to 4) to correctly and completely 
finish this game. I will finish this game after all my final exams.
